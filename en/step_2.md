## Create a model card

Model cards are an approach for describing a Machine Learning model to people who haven’t seen or used the model or applications using the model before. People who want to use a model should be given information to help them understand how effectively the model will work with the data they will be using.

Look at [this example of a model card](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/face-detection){:target="_blank"}, created by designers at google. (Don’t worry, yours won’t need to be as long as this one!)

Notice that it lists the following important information about the model for new users: 
+ What it is intended to do 
+ What it *can’t* do (its limitations)
+ Information about the training data used
+ How well it performs at the intended task
