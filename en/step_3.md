## Complete the submission form

The final step in your Experience AI Music Quest is to share your amazing efforts with us, and the community of other creators participating around the world!

Before you begin the process, make sure you have access to the following things (you need to attach them to the form!):

+ Your finished model card, saved as a pdf or a photo/screenshot.

+ A finished scratch project which creates themed playlists using a trained ML model on ML4Kids

+ A finished scratch project which classifies song data into an ML model on ML4Kids

+ Your answers to the questions:
     - What is your project? What does it do, in your own words? 
     - What did you find difficult about making it? How did you overcome those challenges?
     - If you had more time, what would you change or add to your application?
     - If someone knew about your application and wanted to use it in a way you didnâ€™t intend, can you think of a way they could use it to harm or influence others? If so, how could you stop that from happening?
