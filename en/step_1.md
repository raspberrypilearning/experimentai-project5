Before you move forward with sharing your awesome work with the world, let’s recap the amazing things you’ve accomplished during this quest:

You then made another application to **use that model’s predictions to create playlists** specifically tailored to your user based on the data you gathered, then **play those songs back** to them. 
<br><br>
You have basically created an AI DJ - <span style="color: #0faeb0"><b>That’s amazing!</b><span style="color: #0faeb0">
